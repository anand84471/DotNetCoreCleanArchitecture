#   DotNetCoreCleanArchitecture
Clean architecture puts the business logic and application model at the center of the application. Instead of having business logic depend on data access or other infrastructure concerns, this dependency is inverted: infrastructure and implementation details depend on the Application Core.
This application has following layers
1. Apis/Domain
2. Core
3. Infrastructure
4. Application
